Description: Wow Free CMS

---
Advices:
- Make the code following object oriented concepts, create classes any sign of procedural programming
- Separate markup from programming language => MVC
- Think of introducing an advanced module system (easier to do with OOP & MVC)
- Use abstraction and polymorphism to support alle famous World of Warcraft Server Emulators (at least TrinityCore, MaNGOS and ArcEmu)
- Create a seperate folder or file for configuration and settings
- Make the language system more centralized
